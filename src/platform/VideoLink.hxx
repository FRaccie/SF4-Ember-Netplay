// the encoder's process takes them out in order, captures the game's sound
// itself, and closes the file when told to or when the game goes away, so a
// game closed during an export still leaves a file that plays. The file is
// written as "<name>.part.mp4" and takes its own name only once it holds a
// video, so an export that fails leaves an earlier one of that replay alone.
