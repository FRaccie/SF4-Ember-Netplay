// the game's index does not list yet is archived two minutes after it was

// the one write stores into. The slots are archived first and the replay the
// slot holds has to be in the archive, or nothing is written. The replay is
// written before the indexes; should a write fail after it, the slot's old
// replay is written back. The game holds the slots in memory while it runs
// and writes them back on its next save, so a caller inside the game puts
// the record into its table too, and only after this returned true.
// write stores each changed file: its name under the account's Steam Cloud
// folder (capcom/superstreetfighteriv/ssf4_savedata/<name>) and its bytes.
// The game reads its files through Steam, which keeps its own index of their
// sizes, so a file written beside it is read at its old size: inside the
// game, write goes through Steam's FileWrite.
